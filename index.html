      <h1>What Osmosis Is</h1>

      <p>
        Osmosis is the process of water moving in and out of a cell. More specifically, it is water going from a dilute area (high concentrated area) to a lower concentrated area. During this process, the water passes through a semipermeable membrane. Furthermore, some water particles pass through the membrane at random, but eventually they move to the area of less water until balance is reached on both sides. An example of osmosis is when plants hydrate themselves with their roots. This is an example of osmosis because water particles move to the area with less concentration of water (in this case it is plant roots) until an equilibrium is reached or a balance. So water particles would move from the soil to the plant roots since the plant roots have less water than the soil, until some sort of balance is achieved.

        In summary, Osmosis is:

        <ul>
          <li>Water going from dilute area to a less concentrated area in a cell</li>
          <li>Passes through semi-permeable membrane</li>
          <li>Passes through membrane at random</li>
          <li>Eventually moves to less concentrated area until equilibrium is reached</li>
        <ul>
